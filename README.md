## 🛠️ The Engineering Journey

*From Proof-of-Concept to Generalization*

### 1. Feasibility (Multimodal Adaptation Test)
* **Challenge:** My [previous work](https://github.com/kulsoom-abdullah/Qwen2-VL-Audio-Adapter) adapted audio as an input option to Qwen2. This project tests adding audio to a vision-language model so it can handle audio + vision → text.
* **Method:** Trained on a small set (10 samples) until Loss converged quickly to 0.
* **Result:** Confirmed the end-to-end gradient flow (Audio + Vision → Text) was functional before scaling the training.

### 2. Bias Mitigation (Stratified Scaling)
* **Challenge:** Medical data is often imbalanced. While this set, SurgViVQA, was not severely skewed globally (61% Yes/No), critical categories like `tool_identification` represent only **3.7%** of the data. Random splitting risked leaving these out of the validation set.
* **Solution:** Implemented **Question-Type Stratification** ([`scripts/create_multivideo_split.py`](scripts/create_multivideo_split.py)) to ensure every category (e.g., Tools, Motion, Lesion) was represented in the 15% Eval split.
* **Result:** Achieved **84% accuracy** on safety-critical classes like `occlusion_check`.

### 3. Generalization (Held-Out Video)
* **Challenge:** Prevent the model from overfitting to procedure-specific visual patterns.
* **Method:** Evaluated on a completely unseen video (`002-004`) to test generalization to an unseen video.
* **Result:** **63.4% Accuracy** on held-out test set (+17.4 points over [zero-shot baseline](baselines/baseline2_audio_image.py)).

### 4. Deployment (Streamlit Demo)
* **Output:** Built an interactive app ([`src/app.py`](src/app.py)) with "Flipbook" animation to visualize temporal motion for clinicians.
* **Features:** Question type filtering, 8-frame grid view, animated playback (2 FPS), audio recording with live inference.

## 📊 Data Distribution

I used a portion of the [**SurgViVQA**](https://github.com/madratak/SurgViVQA/) dataset [1], generating audio from the text questions using [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts) to simulate a spoken-query environment.

### Dataset Splits

| Split | Samples | Video IDs (Procedures) | Purpose |
|-------|---------|------------------------|---------|
| **Train** | 2,302 | 002-001, 002-002, 002-003 | Model Training |
| **Eval** | 398 | 002-001, 002-002, 002-003 | In-Training Validation |
| **Test** | 1,000 | 002-004 (held-out) | Generalization Testing |
| **Total** | **3,700** | 4 colonoscopy procedures | 20 question types |

**Terminology:** Each **sample** = 1 question + 8 consecutive frames + 1 answer. **Video IDs** refer to different colonoscopy procedures.

### High-Level Statistics

- **Question Types:** 20 distinct categories across 4 reasoning domains
- **Answer Format Distribution:**
  - **Yes/No questions:** 13 types (65% of question types)
    - Examples: occlusion_check, scope_motion, tool_catheter_check
  - **Limited-Choice questions:** 7 types (35% of question types)
    - 2-5 options per question
    - Examples: lesion_motion_direction (5 directions), lesion_site (4 locations), scope_motion_type (2 types)
- **Answer Distribution (training set):**
  - Yes: 25.7% | No: 35.4% | Limited-choice: 38.8%
- **Held-Out Test Set Characteristics:**
  - Mixed balance: Motion and occlusion questions are balanced (50/50), while tool/dye presence questions in this specific video slice are single-class (100% 'No'), reflecting the specific procedure's nature.
  - Limited-choice questions evenly distributed (e.g., lesion_motion_direction: 20% per direction)
  - Some categories have zero variety (lesion_size_range: 100% <5mm, tool_identification: 100% forceps)

## 📈 Results

### Performance Summary

**Best Checkpoint:** `checkpoint-1000` (epoch 3.48, selected by early stopping)

| Metric | Eval Set | Test Set (Held-Out) |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 67.84% | **63.4%** (634/1000) |
| **Zero-Shot Baselines** | - | 44-46% (text or audio) |
| **Improvement** | - | **+17.4 points** |

**Baseline Comparison:**
I compared an end-to-end audio-adapted model (raw audio → Whisper encoder embeddings; no decoding → projector → Qwen2-VL) against a traditional two-stage pipeline (Whisper ASR text → Qwen2-VL).
* **Accuracy:** Fine-tuning the audio-adapted model improved accuracy from ~46% (zero-shot) to **63.4%**, matching the performance of text-based approaches while using raw audio.
* **Speed:** 2.5× faster end-to-end by skipping intermediate transcription (**0.9s vs 2.3s**, batch=1), equivalent to **1.07 vs 0.43 samples/sec** under the same setup.
* 📄 **Baseline scripts:** [`baseline1_text_image.py`](baselines/baseline1_text_image.py) | [`baseline2_audio_image.py`](baselines/baseline2_audio_image.py) | [`baseline3_asr_pipeline.py`](baselines/baseline3_asr_pipeline.py)

### Key Insights

✅ **What the model does well:**
- Binary Yes/No questions with clear visual signals (98-100%)
- Safety-critical assessments like occlusion detection (84%)
- Some 100% scores are artifacts of single-class test slices.

⚠️ **Where the model struggles:**
- **Multi-way classification** (5-way motion: 20%, 4-way position: 20%)
- **Temporal reasoning** across 8 frames (motion questions: 20-54%)
- **Fine-grained spatial reasoning** (lesion position quadrants: 20%)

**Root causes:**
1. **Frame independence:** Model processes 8 frames independently, lacks video-native temporal modeling
2. **Resolution constraint:** 384px may be too low for precise spatial localization
3. **Limited test variety:** Some perfect scores (100%) are due to single-class test sets (all <5mm, all NBI, all forceps)

📊 **Full evaluation:** Run evaluation script to generate detailed per-sample results

## 📏 Evaluation Methodology

### Metric: Keyword-Based Exact Match Accuracy

Since our questions are classification tasks (binary Yes/No or multi-class with 2-5 options), we evaluate using **answer keyword matching** rather than text generation metrics like BLEU or ROUGE.

**Implementation:**
```python
is_correct = sample['short_answer'].lower() in predicted.lower()
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ **Verifies factual correctness** regardless of phrasing
- ✅ **Allows natural language responses** from the LLM
- ✅ **Standard for factoid QA** (similar to SQuAD, TriviaQA evaluation)

**Example:**

| Ground Truth | Model Response | Evaluated As |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| "left" | "left" | ✅ Correct |
| "left" | "The lesion is moving to the left" | ✅ Correct (contains keyword) |
| "left" | "right" | ❌ Wrong |
| "Yes" | "Yes, there is occlusion present" | ✅ Correct |
| "NBI" | "The lighting mode is NBI" | ✅ Correct |

This is **not** text generation quality evaluation—we only care that the model gets the right factual answer, not how eloquently it phrases it.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The architecture bypasses the standard ASR (Speech-to-Text) pipeline to reduce latency and error propagation, allowing the model to process raw audio embeddings directly alongside visual tokens.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Audio Waveform] -->|Whisper v3 Turbo| B(Audio Encoder)
    B -->|Projector 1280→3584| C(Audio Tokens)
    D[Surgical Frames] -->|Vision Encoder| E(Visual Tokens)
    C --> F[Qwen2-VL Decoder]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Answer]
```

### Audio Adaptation Strategy
* **Base Model:** Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
* **Audio Encoder:** Whisper Large v3 Turbo (Frozen)
* **Projector:** Linear Layer (1280 → 3584) trained to map audio features to the LLM's embedding space
* **Innovation:** Direct injection of 1,500 audio tokens into the multimodal sequence, allowing the model to attend to "sound" and "sight" jointly

### QLoRA Training Config

* **Hardware:** 2x NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM each)
* **Precision:** 4-bit Base Model + BF16 LoRA Adapters
* **LoRA Config:** Rank 64, Alpha 16, targeting all attention/MLP projections
* **Target Modules:** All linear projections (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`, MLP layers)
* **Label Masking:** Strictly mask all vision/audio tokens (`-100`), calculating loss **only** on the assistant's text response
* **Early Stopping:** Patience=3, monitoring eval_loss (training stopped at epoch 4.53, best was 3.48)
* **Training Time:** ~6 hours for 2,300 samples on 2x RTX 4090

### 📈 Training Dynamics (Weights & Biases)

I tracked training stability using Weights & Biases to ensure proper convergence without overfitting.

| **Training Loss** | **Validation Loss (Eval)** |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Train Loss](docs/train_loss.png) | ![Eval Loss](docs/eval_loss.png) |
| *Rapid convergence in first 200 steps* | *Optimal generalization at Step 1000 (Loss ~0.054)* |

**Analysis:**
* **Convergence:** Training loss dropped sharply, confirming the audio features were successfully mapped to the LLM embedding space.
* **Early Stopping:** Validation loss bottomed out at **Step 1000** (Epoch 3.48) and began to rise shortly after (Step 1300), triggering early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting.
* **Total Training Time:** 350 minutes (~5.8 hours) on 2x RTX 4090.

### Memory Optimization Decisions

* **Image Resize:** Downsampled to 384x384. While this impacts small tool detection, it was necessary to fit batch size 1 on consumer VRAM
* **Attention:** Used `sdpa` (Scaled Dot Product Attention) for quantization compatibility
* **Gradient Checkpointing:** Non-reentrant mode for DDP + QLoRA compatibility
